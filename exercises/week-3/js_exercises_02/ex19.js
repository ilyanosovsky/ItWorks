// The following exercise contains the following subjects:
// ‚óè Array
// Instructions
// For each of the questions below, answer the questions with this
// array:
const people = ["Greg", "Mary", "Devon", "James"];

// 1. Using a loop, iterate through this array and console.log all
// of the people.
for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
  console.log(people[i]);
}

// 2. Write the command to remove "Greg" from the array.
const removeFirst = people.shift();
console.log("array without Greg", people);

// 3. Write the command to remove "James" from the array.
const removeLast = people.pop();
console.log("array without James", people);

// 4. Write the command to add "Matt" to the front of the array.
const addFirst = people.unshift("Matt");
console.log("array with Matt", people);

// 5. Write the command to add your name to the end of the
// array.
const addLast = people.push("Ilya");
console.log("array with Ilya", people);

// 6. Using a loop, iterate through this array, and after
// console.log "Mary", exit from the loop.
for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i += 1) {
  console.log(people[i]);
  if (people[i] === "Mary") break;
}

// 7. Write the command to make a copy of the array using a
// slice. The copy should NOT include "Mary" or "Matt".
console.log(people.slice(2));

// 8. Write the command that gives the indexOf where "Mary"
// is located.
console.log(people.indexOf("Mary"));

// 9. Write the command that gives the indexOf where "Foo" is
// located (this should return -1).
console.log(people.indexOf("Foo"));

// 10. Redefine the people variable with the value you started
// with. Using the splice command, remove "Devon" from
// the array and add "Elizabeth"
// and "Artie". Your array should look like this when you are
// done ["Greg", "Mary", "Elizabeth", "Artie",
// "James"].
people = ["Greg", "Mary", "Devon", "James"];
people.splice(2, 1, "Elizabeth", "Artie");
console.log(people);

// 11. Create a new variable called withBob and set it equal
// to the people array concatenated with the string of "Bob"

const withBob = people.concat("Bob");
console.log(withBob);
